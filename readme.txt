=== About ===

The Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W) was a Class I railroad in the United States. It was originally formed in 1881 through the merger of several smaller railroads in Virginia and West Virginia. The N&W primarily operated in the eastern United States, with a significant presence in the Appalachian region.

In 1982, the Norfolk and Western Railway merged with the Southern Railway to form the Norfolk Southern Corporation. The merger marked the end of the Norfolk and Western Railway as an independent entity, but its legacy and history are still remembered and celebrated by rail enthusiasts.


This NewGRF offers a set of (most) telegraph poles used on the Norfolk & Western railroad as placeable objects.
All objects are slope-aware, with parameters for the Scenario Editor.



=== Parameters ===

-> Only in Scenario Editor = Objects can be placed only when creating a scenario.
-> Irremovable objects     = Built objects (in the editor or otherwise) can be removed only by using Magic bulldozer.
